My personal memex written in Rust. This probably won't make sense for your data :).

I use this to search on a sqlite3 database where I keep [tweets](https://www.twitter.com/elias_era)/social media things, and my [Digital Garden ](https://wiki.anarchist.work).

## Details
- My sqlite3 is written by [petl](https://www.github.com/era/petl)
- My digital garden is a bunch of markdown files, which I transform in html to server at https://wiki.anarchist.work
